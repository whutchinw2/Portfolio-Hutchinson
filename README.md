# Portfolio-Hutchinson

This is my first portfolio for coding.
This portfolio will contain my efforts to successfully learn coding and make this a new career!
In this project i have used a few different images to relect my "about me" section
My past and future projects (currently just containing a link to my git hub)
I have a section for my basic resume over the last eight years and a "contact me" section containing my email, phone number and github user name.

Each section has a light that glows when the curser goes over each of them.

I also have links for each section when clicked scroll down to the corresponding section.

My header includes a photo of myself and a sub header "The name is Hutchinson, Bill Hutchinson"

The link in projects takes you directly to my github.
